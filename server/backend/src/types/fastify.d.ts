/**
 * Declaration merging for what @fastify/jwt puts on a request.
 *
 * Until this interface says otherwise, `request.user` is `unknown`, which is why the
 * controllers used to reach for `request.user as any`. The shape is not a guess: it is what
 * both `jwt.sign` calls in AuthController put into the token, and the two must stay in step.
 *
 * `id` is a number because `users.id` is INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT. Route parameters are
 * strings, so comparisons against one still have to bridge that gap.
