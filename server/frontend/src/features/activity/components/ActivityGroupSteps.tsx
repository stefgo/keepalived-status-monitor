/**
 * The members of one correlated group -- an operation and everything it caused.

 * They used to be a `steps` column on the entry they belonged to: a list of sentences the
 * server had appended, with no id, no level and no life of their own. They are ordinary
 * events now, which is why this renders exactly what the top-level list renders, only
 * smaller: each one can be filtered, carries its own level and its own timestamp, and
 * arrives whenever it arrives rather than within a window the server kept open for it.
