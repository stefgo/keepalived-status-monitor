/**
 * Every key the application writes to the browser's storage, once. **No key literal
 * anywhere else**: a key spelled in a component is one nobody finds again.
 *
 * A key reads `kasm.<area>.<what>`. `<area>` is the page or list that owns the value, so
 * the keys of one page sort together in the browser's storage panel; the prefix keeps
 * them apart from whatever else is served from the same origin.
 *
 * Renaming a key forgets what was stored under the old one. That is the whole cost --
 * every value here is a preference that is set again with one click -- so a rename needs
 * no migration.
