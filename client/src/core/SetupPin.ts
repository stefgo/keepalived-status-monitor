/**
 * The PIN that guards registration -- `POST /api/register` on the agent's own web server,
 * where the agent is pointed at a server (inbound), and `/ws/register`, where a server
 * dials in and hands the agent its identity (outbound).
 *
 * Both decide which server this agent trusts from then on. They listen on every interface,
 * and whoever registers the agent receives what it reports about this host and can make it
 * signal keepalived. Before this PIN, anyone who could reach the agent's web port could do
 * that through the register page, and outbound registration needed a secret the operator had
 * to write into config.yaml first.
 *
 * So the check is a shared secret that is printed to the agent's log, where only someone who
 * can already read the machine's logs (`docker logs kasm-client`) can see it. An agent given
 * `KASM_REGISTRATION_SECRET` for an unattended rollout accepts that on `/ws/register` as well.
 *
 * Unlike in an agent that can be registered only once, re-registering is a feature here (the
 * status page offers it), so the PIN exists whenever the register page is enabled -- not only
 * while the agent has no token. Without the page it exists only while the agent waits for an
 * outbound registration and has no secret. It is rotated after every successful registration,
 * which makes each PIN single use without requiring a restart for the next one.
 *
 * Deliberately never persisted to config.yaml: it is regenerated on every start, and what is
 * never written never has to be cleaned up.
