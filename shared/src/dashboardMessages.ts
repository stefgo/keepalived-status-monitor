/**
 * Every message the server pushes over `/ws/dashboard`, as one discriminated union.
 *
 * Both ends hang on it. The backend's `broadcastToDashboard` takes a `DashboardMessage`, so
 * it cannot send a shape that is not listed here; the dashboard parses against the schema
 * and dispatches in a `switch` that ends in `assertNever`, so a member added here without a
 * case there fails `typecheck`.
 *
 * A union over `type` rather than separate parses: the dashboard sees one stream, and a
 * message of an unknown type has to fail here, not somewhere downstream. The server is
 * trusted, so this is a guard against version drift between the two halves, not against an
 * attacker.
